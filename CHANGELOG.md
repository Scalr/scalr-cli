# Changelog

## v0.next — UX & Scripting Overhaul

This release transforms the Scalr CLI from a raw API wrapper into a productivity tool for both interactive use and CI/CD automation. Every change is backward compatible — existing scripts that parse JSON output continue to work unchanged.

---

### Table Output (auto-detected)

Use `-format=table` to get aligned, scannable output. JSON remains the default for full backward compatibility — existing scripts are not affected.

```
$ scalr -format=table list-workspaces
ID            NAME           STATUS     TERRAFORM-VERSION  AUTO-APPLY  EXECUTION-MODE
----------    -----------    --------   -----------------  ----------  --------------
ws-abc123     production     applied    1.7.0              true        remote
ws-def456     staging        planned    1.7.0              false       remote
ws-ghi789     dev-sandbox    applied    1.6.6              true        local
(page 1 of 1, 3 total)

$ scalr list-workspaces              # JSON by default — no breaking change
[
  { "id": "ws-abc123", "name": "production", ... },
  ...
]
```

**Why this matters:** Scanning 50 workspaces in raw JSON required mental gymnastics. Tables let you find what you need at a glance.

---

### CSV Export

Pipe your infrastructure inventory straight into spreadsheets or text-processing tools.

```
$ scalr list-workspaces -format=csv > workspaces.csv
$ scalr list-environments -format=csv | cut -d',' -f1,2
```

---

### Human-Readable Errors

API errors used to dump raw JSONAPI objects. Now you get a single clear line.

**Before:**
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "422",
      "title": "Unprocessable Entity",
      "detail": "Name has already been taken",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/name" }
    }
  ]
}
```

**After:**
```
Error: 422: Unprocessable Entity: Name has already been taken (field: /data/attributes/name)
```

---

### Command Aliases

Short names for the commands you type most. Full names still work.

| Alias | Expands to |
|-------|-----------|
| `ws` | `get-workspaces` |
| `envs` | `list-environments` |
| `runs` | `get-runs` |
| `vars` | `get-variables` |
| `tags` | `list-tags` |
| `accs` | `get-accounts` |
| `pols` | `list-policy-groups` |
| `sa` | `get-service-accounts` |
| `teams` | `get-teams` |
| `users` | `get-users` |
| `vcs` | `list-vcs-providers` |
| `mods` | `list-modules` |

```
$ scalr ws                    # same as: scalr list-workspaces
$ scalr envs -format=csv      # same as: scalr list-environments -format=csv
```

---

### Field Selection

Only show the fields you care about. Works with all output formats.

```
$ scalr list-workspaces -fields=id,name,status
ID          NAME          STATUS
--------    ----------    --------
ws-abc123   production    applied
ws-def456   staging       planned

$ scalr get-workspace -workspace=ws-abc123 -fields=name,terraform-version -format=json
{
  "name": "production",
  "terraform-version": "1.7.0"
}
```

---

### Column Control for Tables

Override which columns appear and their order.

```
$ scalr list-runs -columns=id,status,source,created-at
```

---

### Pagination Control

The CLI used to silently fetch every page. Now you can browse page by page or control the batch size.

```
$ scalr list-workspaces -page=1 -page-size=5     # first 5 results
$ scalr list-workspaces -page=2 -page-size=5     # next 5
```

Default behavior (fetch all pages) is preserved when you don't set these flags.

---

### Dot-Path Queries

Extract specific values without piping through `jq`.

```
$ scalr get-workspace -workspace=ws-abc123 -query=.name
production

$ scalr list-workspaces -query=.[].id
ws-abc123
ws-def456
ws-ghi789

$ scalr list-workspaces -query=.[].name
production
staging
dev-sandbox
```

Simple scalar values print as plain text (one per line). Complex values print as JSON.

---

### Open in Browser

Jump straight to the Scalr dashboard for any resource from the terminal.

```
$ scalr open account                          # account dashboard
$ scalr open environment production           # environment by name
$ scalr open workspace my-workspace           # workspace by name
$ scalr open run run-abc123                   # specific run
```

Short aliases work too: `scalr open env production`, `scalr open ws my-workspace`.

For workspaces and runs, the CLI automatically resolves parent IDs (workspace's environment, run's workspace and environment) so you only need to provide the resource itself. The URL is always printed to stderr so you can see it even in headless environments.

Works cross-platform: uses `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, and `rundll32` on Windows.

---

### Wait for Run Completion

The most-requested feature for CI/CD pipelines. Instead of writing a shell loop that polls and parses JSON, use one command.

```
$ scalr wait-for-run -run=run-abc123
Waiting for run run-abc123...
Status: pending
pending -> planning
planning -> planned
planned -> applying
applying -> applied
Run run-abc123 completed successfully (applied)
```

The command prints status transitions to stderr and the final run data to stdout. Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure.

It also detects states that require human action (policy approval, cost review, apply confirmation) and exits immediately instead of hanging:

```
$ scalr wait-for-run -run=run-def456
Waiting for run run-def456...
Status: pending
pending -> planning
planning -> policy_checked
Run run-def456 requires approval (status: policy_checked). Cannot proceed automatically.
```

Set a custom timeout with `-timeout=10m` (default: 30 minutes).

---

### Name-to-ID Resolution

Stop looking up IDs before every command. Use names directly — the CLI resolves them for you.

```
$ scalr get-workspace -workspace=production
Resolved workspace 'production' -> ws-abc123
{ ... }

$ scalr list-runs -workspace=staging
Resolved workspace 'staging' -> ws-def456
{ ... }
```

If the name matches multiple resources, you'll see the options:
```
Error: Multiple workspace resources match name 'test':
  ws-abc123  test
  ws-def456  test-2
Please specify the exact ID.
```

Values that already look like IDs (e.g., `ws-abc123`) skip resolution entirely — zero overhead for existing usage.

Supported resources: workspace, environment, account, tag, role, team, vcs-provider, agent-pool.

---

### Configuration Profiles

Manage multiple Scalr instances without juggling environment variables.

```
$ scalr -configure                    # creates "default" profile (backward compatible)

# Manually add profiles to ~/.scalr/scalr.conf:
{
  "default":  { "hostname": "prod.scalr.io",    "token": "...", "account": "acc-xxx" },
  "staging":  { "hostname": "staging.scalr.io",  "token": "...", "account": "acc-yyy" }
}

$ scalr ws                            # uses "default"
$ scalr ws -profile=staging           # uses "staging"
$ SCALR_PROFILE=staging scalr ws      # same thing via env var
```

Existing flat-format `scalr.conf` files continue to work without changes.

---

### Progress Spinner

A subtle spinner shows that the CLI is working during API calls. Automatically hidden when output is piped or stderr is not a terminal.

```
$ scalr list-workspaces
/ Fetching page 2...
```

---

### Scripting & CI/CD Improvements

#### Structured Exit Codes

Scripts can now distinguish between error types for proper retry logic.

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **0** | Success | Continue |
| **1** | Error (bad input, 4xx, missing flags, not found) | Fail the pipeline |
| **3** | Transient error (5xx, network, timeout) | Retry safely |

Exit code 1 is unchanged from previous versions — all non-transient errors. Exit code 3 is new and additive: scripts that check `!= 0` continue to work, while scripts that want smarter retry can check for 3 specifically.

```bash
scalr create-workspace -name=prod -environment-id=env-xxx
rc=$?
case $rc in
  0) echo "Created" ;;
  3) echo "Server issue, retrying..." && sleep 5 && retry ;;
  *) echo "Failed" && exit 1 ;;
esac
```

#### Automatic Retry for Server Errors

API calls now retry automatically (up to 3 times with exponential backoff) on 5xx server errors and network failures. Client errors (4xx) fail immediately — no wasted time retrying bad requests.

#### HTTP Request Timeout

All requests have a 30-second timeout. Scripts no longer hang indefinitely on unresponsive servers.

#### Clean stdout/stderr Separation

All data output (JSON, table, CSV) goes to **stdout**. All diagnostics (errors, warnings, progress, resolution messages, verbose traces) go to **stderr**. This includes `-verbose` mode, which previously leaked HTTP debug info to stdout and broke JSON parsing.

```bash
# This now works correctly — verbose debug goes to stderr, clean JSON to stdout:
scalr list-workspaces -verbose 2>/dev/null | jq '.[0].name'
```

#### No-Color Mode

ANSI colors are automatically disabled when `CI` or `NO_COLOR` environment variables are set (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.). Also available as `-no-color` flag.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions — colors disabled automatically
- run: scalr list-workspaces

# Or explicitly:
- run: scalr list-workspaces -no-color
```
